1. We began by compiling a comprehensive list of tasks outlined in
the paper.
2. Next, we assigned a duration to each task.
3. An additional column was added to account for the cost associated
with each task.
4. To establish task dependencies, we linked each task to its
predecessor.
5. Moving to project settings in the project information section, we set
the start date to today.
6. By accessing the statistics feature, we obtained the overall project
duration and total cost:
Duration: 344 days
Total Cost: $275,100.00
7. We then calculated the daily salary for the IT personnel trainer:
$4600 divided by 6 days, resulting in approximately $766.67.
